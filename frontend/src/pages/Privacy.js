      <h1 className="status__h1 py-5">STUDENT ACCOMMODATION</h1>
      <p>
        If you've chosen your course and institution, the next step is to start
        thinking about your accommodation options. Keep in mind that most
        institutions will have accommodation services to help you. Opera
        educational consultancy will help students for their housing and
        accomodation whichever country or university he/she chooses. Our team
        will take care of the accomodation needs for the students reaching at
        their study destination.We will provide information on the range of
        accommodation options and their associated costs and help you prepare to
        make the move.
      </p>
      <h5 className="my-4">Types of student accommodation</h5>
      <li>Halls of residence and colleges</li>
      <li>College apartments</li>
      <li>Homestay</li>
      <li>Renting</li>
      <li>Hostels</li>
      <h5 className="my-4">Halls of residence and colleges</h5>
      <p>
        These are usually affiliated with or owned by an institution and are
        located on campus or close to it. Students usually rent a single bedroom
        and share facilities like bathrooms and kitchen facilities, although
        some institutions may provide apartment-style rooms with private
        bathrooms and kitchenettes.
      </p>
      <p>
        All utilities (electricity, gas and water) are included in the fees, and
        internet access is usually provided in each room, although this may not
        be included in the cost of the room. Colleges tend to offer a range of
        student services such as daily meals in a formal dining room and
        academic tuition, while residences may offer students more independence,
        often giving students the ability to make their own meals in shared
        kitchens.
      </p>
      <h5 className="my-4">College apartments</h5>
      <p>
        College apartments provide students with a more independent style of
        living than university colleges or halls of residence. Apartments are
        generally self-contained and include a kitchen, bathroom and small
        living area. Utilities may or may not be covered in the rental costs and
        you may have to pay extra for internet and phone services. You may find
        that some apartments are affiliated with institutions, while others are
        privately owned.
      </p>
      <h5 className="my-4">Homestay</h5>
      <p>
        This involves renting a room in a private home and sharing with the
        existing owners (usually a family). You will usually have your own
        bedroom and share most facilities. Meals may be provided.
      </p>
      <h5 className="my-4">Renting</h5>
      <p>
        This may involve moving out on your own or into a shared house or flat
        with friends (or even strangers). You can find share houses through word
        of mouth, real estate websites, newspapers or on student noticeboards on
        campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cost of rental accommodation varies greatly depending on your
        location, as well as the type of accommodation you choose (a house or
        apartment, for example).
      </p>
      <h5 className="my-4">Hostels</h5>
      <p>
        Hostel accommodation is a popular option for students who are moving
        from a regional area, interstate or overseas to study. They often
        provide a good short-term option until something more permanent can be
        arranged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hostels generally provide a furnished bedroom with access to a shared
        bathroom and kitchen, laundry, lounge area and recreation facilities
        (such as pool tables and arcade game machines). You may find that meals
        are provided, although this is not always the case. There is sometimes
        the option to stay in dorm-style or twin-share rooms, and short-term
        rental options are generally available.
        <br />
        The price of hostel accommodation depends both on location and the types
        of services provided. You can also expect to pay more for private or
        twin-share rooms than dorm-style accommodation.
      </p>
      <h1 className="status__h1 py-5">FINANCIAL AIDS</h1>
      <p>
        Financial aid is money to help pay for college. Grants, work-study,
        loans, and scholarships help make college affordable. Opera
        International Educational Consultancy team will help each of the
        students if they are applying for a financial aid such as educational
        loans, scholarships etc.
      </p>
      <h5 className="my-4">Scholarships</h5>
      <p>
        Scholarships are also gift aid. Scholarships come from governments,
        colleges and private organizations. They may be awarded for academic or
        athletic ability, interest in a certain subject, or volunteer work, for
        example. International students are eligible for applying for
        scholarships in various countries. Students can find various
        scholarships from sites like DAAD. Our team will support for your dream
        study destination.
      </p>
      <h5 className="my-4">Loans</h5>
      <p>
        Borrowing money from a bank, government or lending company is called
        taking out a loan. A loan must be paid back with an extra charge called
        interest. All loans are considered self-help aid. Loans must be repaid
        and all loans are optional.Unlike consumer loans, student loans have
        longer terms of repayment and in most cases do not enter repayment until
        you leave school. Interest rates vary but are usually lower than rates
        on loans made to the general public. The precise terms of the loans are
        contained in the promissory notes that borrowers must sign.
      </p>
      <h5 className="my-4">Work-Study Program</h5>
      <p>
        Work-study is a component of self-help aid. The work-study program at
        which university or college you are stdying is designed to promote the
        part-time employment of college students who have demonstrated financial
        need and who require the wages from employment to pursue their
        educational objectives. Opera international team will help and support
        students to find a part time jobs in the area near college/university
        for students to pay for part of their college fees/cost of living.
